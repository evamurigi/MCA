# Dimensionality reduction

MCA stands for Multiple Correspondence Analysis. It is a statistical technique used for analyzing categorical data and exploring relationships among categorical variables. MCA is an extension of Correspondence Analysis (CA), which is used for analyzing contingency tables.

In MCA, the categorical variables are represented as points in a low-dimensional space. The goal is to visualize the relationships between the variables and identify patterns or associations among them. MCA transforms the categorical data into a numerical representation and computes a set of dimensions (components) that capture the most significant relationships in the data.
